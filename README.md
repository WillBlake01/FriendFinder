# Friend Finder

*What does it do?*<br>
Friend Finder is a full stack application to match anonymous users based on answers to a standardized personality quiz. The application takes the users answers and finds the closest match based on other users' answers.

*Why is this useful?*<br>
Anyone who is busy, new to a city, or has ever been lonely can see the value in using the internet to match with people outside of your immediate proximity.

*How can I get started?* <br>
Navigate to the site URL and click "Go to Survey". Once you have filled out all fields and submit the app will display a window with the name and picture of the person that is the best match.

*What technologies are used?*<br>
Node.js<br>
Express js<br>


*Where can I get help?*<br>
